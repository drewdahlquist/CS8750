        "Prior to actually using spacy, we need to load in some models.  The basic model is their small core library, taken from the web: `en_core_web_sm`, which provides good, basic functionality with a small download size (< 20 MB).  However, one drawback of this basic model is that it doesn't have full word vectors.  Instead, it comes with context-sensitive tensors.  You can still do things like text similarity with it, but if you want to use spacy to create good word vectors, you should use a larger model such as `en_core_web_md` or`en_core_web_lg` since the small models are not known for accuracy.  You can also use a variety of third-party models, but that is beyond the scope of this workshop.  Again, choose the model that works best with your setup.\n",

The Missouri River, after which the state is named, flows through the center into the Mississippi River, which makes up the eastern border. With more than six million residents, it is the 19th-most populous state of the country. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia; the capital is Jefferson City.\\nHumans have inhabited what is now Missouri for at least 12,000 years. The Mississippian culture, which emerged at least in the ninth century, built cities and mounds before declining in the 14th century. When European explorers arrived in the 17th century, they encountered the Osage and Missouria nations. The French incorporated the territory into Louisiana, founding Ste. Genevieve in 1735 and St. Louis in 1764. After a brief period of Spanish rule, the United States acquired Missouri as part of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. Americans from the Upland South rushed into the new Missouri Territory. Missouri was admitted as a slave state as part of the Missouri Compromise of 1820. Many from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee settled in the Boonslick area of Mid-Missouri. Soon after, heavy German immigration formed the Missouri Rhineland.\\nMissouri played a central role in the westward expansion of the United States, as memorialized by the Gateway Arch. The Pony Express, Oregon Trail, Santa Fe Trail and California Trail all began in Missouri. As a border state, Missouri\\'s role in the American Civil War was complex, and it was subject to rival governments, raids, and guerilla warfare. After the war, both Greater St. Louis and the Kansas City metropolitan area became centers of industrialization and business. Today the state is divided into 114 counties and the independent city of St. Louis.\\nMissouri\\'s culture blends elements of the Midwestern and Southern United States. It is the birthplace of the musical genres ragtime, Kansas City jazz and St. Louis blues. The well-known Kansas City-style barbecue, and the lesser-known St. Louis-style barbecue, can be found across the state and beyond. Missouri is a major center of beer brewing and has some of the most permissive alcohol laws in the U.S. It is home to Anheuser-Busch, the world\\'s largest beer producer, and produces an eponymous wine produced in the Missouri Rhineland and Ozarks. Outside the state\\'s major cities, popular tourist destinations include the Lake of the Ozarks, Table Rock Lake and Branson.\\nWell-known Missourians include Chuck Berry, Sheryl Crow, Walt Disney, Edwin Hubble, Nelly, Brad Pitt, Harry S. Truman, and Mark Twain. Some of the largest companies based in the state include Cerner, Express Scripts, Monsanto, Emerson Electric, Edward Jones, H&R Block, Wells Fargo Advisors, Centene Corporation, and O\\'Reilly Auto Parts. Well-known universities in Missouri include the University of Missouri, Saint Louis University, and Washington University in St. Louis. Missouri has been called the \"Mother of the West\", the \"Cave State\", and the \"Show Me State\".\\n\\n\\n== Etymology and pronunciation ==\\nThe state is named for the Missouri River, which was named after the indigenous Missouria, a Siouan-language tribe. French colonists adapted a form of the Illinois language-name for the people: Wimihsoorita.  Their name means \"One who has dugout canoes\".The name Missouri has several different pronunciations even among its present-day inhabitants, the two most common being  (listen) mih-ZUR-ee and  (listen) mih-ZUR-ə. Further pronunciations also exist in Missouri or elsewhere in the United States, involving the realization of the medial consonant as either  or ; the vowel in the second syllable as either  or ; and the third syllable as  (phonetically [i] (listen), [ɪ] (listen), or [ɪ̈] (listen)) or . Any combination of these phonetic realizations may be observed coming from speakers of American English, except for a final [ɪ] which does not occur in most dialects (see Happy tensing). In British received pronunciation, the preferred variant is , with  being a possible alternative.The linguistic history was treated definitively by Donald M. Lance, who acknowledged that the question is sociologically complex, but no pronunciation could be declared \"correct\", nor could any be clearly defined as native or outsider, rural or urban, southern or northern, educated or otherwise. Politicians often employ multiple pronunciations, even during a single speech, to appeal to a greater number of listeners. In informal contexts respellings of the state\\'s name, such as \"Missour-ee\" or \"Missour-uh\", are occasionally used to distinguish pronunciations phonetically.\\n\\n\\n=== Nicknames ===\\nThere is no official state nickname. However, Missouri\\'s unofficial nickname is the \"Show Me State,\" which appears on its license plates. This phrase has several origins. One is popularly ascribed to a speech by Congressman Willard Vandiver in 1899, who declared that \"I come from a state that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs and Democrats, and frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I\\'m from Missouri, and you have got to show me.\" This is in keeping with the saying \"I\\'m from Missouri,\" which means \"I\\'m skeptical of the matter and not easily convinced.\" However, according to researchers, the phrase \"show me\" was already in use before the 1890s. Another one states that it is a reference to Missouri miners who were taken to Leadville, Colorado to replace striking workers. Since the new miners were unfamiliar with the mining methods, they required frequent instruction.Other nicknames for Missouri include \"The Lead State\", \"The Bullion State\", \"The Ozark State\", \"The Mother of the West\", \"The Iron Mountain State\", and \"Pennsylvania of the West\". It is also known as the \"Cave State\":\\u200a53\\u200a because there are more than 7,300 recorded caves in the state (second to Tennessee). Perry County is the county with the largest number of caves and the single longest cave.The official state motto is Latin: \"Salus Populi Suprema Lex Esto\", which means \"Let the welfare of the people be the supreme law.\"\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== Early history ===\\nArchaeological excavations along river valleys have shown continuous habitation since about 9000 BCE. Beginning before 1000 CE, the people of the Mississippian culture created regional political centers at present-day St. Louis and across the Mississippi River at Cahokia, near present-day Collinsville, Illinois. Their large cities included thousands of individual residences. Still, they are known for their surviving massive earthwork mounds, built for religious, political and social reasons, in platform, ridgetop and conical shapes. Cahokia was the center of a regional trading network that reached from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. The civilization declined by 1400 CE, and most descendants left the area long before the arrival of Europeans. St. Louis was at one time known as Mound City by the European Americans because of the numerous surviving prehistoric mounds since lost to urban development. The Mississippian culture left mounds throughout the middle Mississippi and Ohio river valleys, extending into the southeast and the upper river.\\n\\nThe land that became the state of Missouri was part of numerous different territories possessed changing and often indeterminate borders and had many different Native American and European names between the 1600s and statehood. For much of the first half of the 1700s, the west bank of the Mississippi River that would become Missouri was mostly uninhabited, something of a no man\\'s land that kept peace between the Illinois on the east bank of the Mississippi River and to the North, and the Osage and Missouri Indians of the lower Missouri Valley. In the early 1700s, French traders and missionaries explored the whole of the Mississippi Valley, named the region “Louisiana.” Around the same time, a different group of French Canadians who established five villages on the east bank of the Mississippi River placed their settlements in the le pays des Illinois, “the country of the Illinois.” When habitants – settlers of French Canadian descent – began crossing the Mississippi River to establish settlements such as Ste. Genevieve, they continued to place their settlements in the Illinois Country. At the same time, the French settlements on both sides of the Mississippi River were part of the French province of Louisiana. To distinguish the settlements in the Middle Mississippi Valley from French settlements in the lower Mississippi Valley around New Orleans, French officials and inhabitants referred to the Middle Mississippi Valley as La Haute Louisiane, “The High Louisiana,” or “Upper Louisiana.”\\nThe first European settlers were mostly ethnic French Canadians, who created their first settlement in Missouri at present-day Ste. Genevieve, about an hour south of St. Louis. They had migrated about 1750 from the Illinois Country. They came from colonial villages on the east side of the Mississippi River, where soils were becoming exhausted, and there was insufficient river bottom land for the growing population. The early Missouri settlements included many enslaved Africans and Native Americans, and slave labor was central to both commercial agriculture and the fur trade. Sainte-Geneviève became a thriving agricultural center, producing enough surplus wheat, corn and tobacco to ship tons of grain annually downriver to Lower Louisiana for trade. Grain production in the Illinois Country was critical to the survival of Lower Louisiana and especially the city of New Orleans.\\nSt. Louis was founded soon after by French fur traders, Pierre Laclède '"
